Greetings Professors, we are Group 19 of class COSC2430 and this is the instruction video for our website. 
I am currently at the very first page of our website, the index.php. Here, users can click login if they want to use their existing accounts, or they can choose the role for the new accounts they are about to create. After clicking on one of the three options: vendor, customer, or shipper, they will be directed to the registration page corresponding to the role they have chosen. They need to fill out the required fields displayed on that page to finish registering. Each field may or may not have input constraint relating to length and character, and if the users violate at least one constraint, there will be message(s) to notify them. 
For the username field, apart from having to meet the length and character constraints, users must enter a name that never appears in the whole systemâ€™s username record. Meanwhile, each vendor account must use a unique business address and business name. These unique constraints use php, so the error will be displayed on the screen only after the users submit the form.
Only after fulfilling all the criteria, would the users receive a message and a record of their registration information. Now, they can click Login to access that newly created account. 
In the login page, you can log in to the website by the account that you register before. After logging in you will be redirected to the my account page. In this page it will show all the information you provided when you signed up. You can also change the profile picture by clicking the change profile picture button. Then choose the picture you want to change and click submit. And now your profile picture has been changed.
